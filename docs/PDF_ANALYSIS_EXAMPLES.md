**User**: *[Uploads research paper PDF]*
"Summarize this paper and create bullet points of the key findings"

**AI**: "This research paper examines the impact of artificial intelligence on educational outcomes in K-12 settings. The study was conducted over 18 months with 500 students across 10 schools.

**Key Findings:**
• AI-assisted learning improved test scores by an average of 15%
• Student engagement increased by 23% when using AI tools
• Teachers reported 30% reduction in grading time
• Personalized learning paths showed the most significant impact
• Implementation challenges included technical infrastructure and teacher training

The paper concludes that AI integration, when properly implemented with adequate support, can significantly enhance educational outcomes while reducing teacher workload."

**User**: "What methodology did they use?"

**AI**: "The researchers employed a mixed-methods approach:

**Quantitative Methods:**
